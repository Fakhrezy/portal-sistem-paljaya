# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` contains the source code
- `public/` contains static assets

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
